<h1> express-playground </h1>
<p><h3> starter project for express based websites </h3></p>

<p>
The express-playground project is written in es6 and uses <code>babel</code> to transpile all its source code.
It also uses <code>browserify</code> to bundle all the transpiled client code, <code>node-sass</code>
to generate the css files, and the <code>ejs</code> template engine for rendering html.
</p>

<p>
The <code>npm run watch</code> and <code>npm run start</code> commands allow for
serving the website by running a basic <code>express</code> server which can be customized later on.
The <code>npm run render</code> command renders a static html website like this one.
</p>

<!--
<p>
The main html template is the <code>views/default.ejs</code> file, providing the basic
structure of a responsive website.
</p>

<p>
The main entry point to modify the architecture of the website is the <code>src/server/routes.js</code> file.
Each route specifies its own <code>ejs</code> template file, as well as relevant data to populate it.
