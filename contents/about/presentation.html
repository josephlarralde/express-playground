<h1> express-playground </h1>
<p>
  <h3> starter project for express based websites </h3>
</p>

<p>
  This website has been built with
  <a href="https://github.com/josephlarralde/express-playground">
    express-playground
  </a> using the <code>npm run render</code> command (see Documentation).
</p>

<p>
This project is written in es6 and uses <code>babel</code> to transpile all the source code.
It also uses <code>browserify</code> to bundle all the transpiled client code, <code>node-sass</code>
to generate the <code>css</code> files, and the <code>ejs</code> template engine for rendering html.
</p>

<p>
It can be used as a tool to build static html websites like this one, or it can
run a basic express server that can be customized to fulfill some requirements.
</p>

<p>
The main html template is the <code>views/default.ejs</code> file, providing the basic
structure of a responsive website.
</p>

<p>
The main entry point to modify the architecture of the website is the <code>src/server/routes.js</code> file.
Each route specifies its own <code>ejs</code> template file, as well as relevant data to populate it.
</p>

<p>
When using the <code>default.ejs</code> template, the relevant data includes html contents,
specified in the <code>data.articles</code> field, which will be looked for in the `contents` directory.
It also includes the menu definition, specified in the <code>data.menu</code> field.
The menu designed to be used with the <code>default.ejs</code> template is defined in the <code>src/server/menus.js</code> file,
and is referenced as <code>main</code>.
